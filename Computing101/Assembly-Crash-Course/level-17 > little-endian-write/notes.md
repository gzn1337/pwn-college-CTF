# Level description

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run, the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand and where you should put the result. In most cases, it's rax.

In this level, you will be working with memory. This will require you to read or write to things stored linearly in memory. If you are confused, go look at the linear addressing module in 'ike. You may also be asked to dereference things, possibly multiple times, to things we dynamically put in memory for your use.

It is worth noting, as you may have noticed, that values are stored in reverse order of how we represent them.

As an example, say:

[0x1330] = 0x00000000deadc0de

If you examined how it actually looked in memory, you would see:

[0x1330] = 0xde
[0x1331] = 0xc0
[0x1332] = 0xad
[0x1333] = 0xde
[0x1334] = 0x00
[0x1335] = 0x00
[0x1336] = 0x00
[0x1337] = 0x00

This format of storing things in 'reverse' is intentional in x86, and it's called "Little Endian".

For this challenge, we will give you two addresses created dynamically each run.

The first address will be placed in rdi. The second will be placed in rsi.

Using the earlier mentioned info, perform the following:

    Set [rdi] = 0xdeadbeef00001337
    Set [rsi] = 0xc0ffee0000

Hint: it may require some tricks to assign a big constant to a dereferenced register. Try setting a register to the constant value, then assigning that register to the dereferenced register.

# Solution

1. Create the file:
```bash
nano solution.asm
```

2. Write the following in `solution.asm`:
```asm
global _start

_start:

	mov rax, 0xdeadbeef00001337
	mov [rdi], rax
	mov rcx, 0xc0ffee0000
	mov [rsi], rcx
```

3. Assemble:
```bash
nasm -f elf64 solution.asm -o solution.o
```

4. Link:
```bash
ld solution.o -o solution
```

5. Run the challenge:
```bash
/challenge/run /home/hacker/solution
```

6. Result:
- Flag received — output saved in `little-endian-write.png`.

# Notes

write given constants into addresses provided in **rdi** and **rsi**, avoid using the constants as addresses.

## Steps explained

1. **Create the assembly file**: `nano solution.asm` — the file will contain our code to capture the flag.

2. **Assembly code**:
- `global _start` → declares the entry point for the linker.
- `_start:` → line where execution begins.
- `mov rax, 0xdeadbeef00001337` → load 64 bit constant into **rax**.
- `mov [rdi], rax` → store **rax** into memory at address in **rdi**.
- `mov rcx, 0xc0ffee0000` → load 64 bit constant into **rcx**.
- `mov [rsi], rcx` → store **rcx** into memory at address in **rsi**.

3. **Assemble**: `nasm` converts the human-readable assembly into an object file (`solution.o`) — machine code + info for the linker. Use `-f elf64` for 64-bit Linux.

4. **Link**: `ld solution.o -o solution` produces the final executable.

5. **Run**: `/challenge/run /home/hacker/solution` submits the executable to the challenge environment, which verifies the registers and returns the flag if requirements are met.

6. **Flag**: Output captured in `little-endian-write.png`.
