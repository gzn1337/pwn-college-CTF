# PwnCollege â€” Cybersecurity Notes & Solutions

This repository documents my journey through the **PwnCollege** challenges.  
It is a collection of solutions, structured notes, and references aimed at learning and sharing practical cybersecurity knowledge.
---

Each challenge folder should contain:
```
- `solution.*` files 
- `notes.md` clear walkthrough and explanations  
- optional `screenshots/` with outputs or flags
```

## Goals  
```
- Build a practical **knowledge base** covering:  
  - Assembly 
  - Binary exploitation 
  - Reverse engineering  
  - Cryptography  
  - Web vulnerabilities
  - Produce clear, reproducible write-ups to improve my skills and help others learn.
```

## Conclusion
This repo is a learning log and practical cybersecurity reference. It will grow as I progress through PwnCollege and other CTFs.  
Feedback, questions, and pull requests are welcome.
