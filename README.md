# PwnCollege â€” Cybersecurity Notes & Solutions

This repository documents my journey through the **PwnCollege** challenges.  
It is a collection of solutions, structured notes, and references aimed at learning and sharing practical cybersecurity knowledge.

```

Each challenge folder should contain:
- `solution.*` files 
- `notes.md` clear walkthrough and explanations  
- optional `screenshots/` with outputs or flags

---

## ðŸ§­ Goals
- Document solutions to **learn deeply** from each challenge.  
- Build a practical **knowledge base** covering:  
  - Assembly & system calls  
  - Binary exploitation (ROP, format strings, heap)  
  - Reverse engineering  
  - Cryptography  
  - Web vulnerabilities  
  - Forensics & misc topics  
- Produce clear, reproducible write-ups that help others learn.

## ðŸŒŸ Final Notes
This repo is a learning log and practical cybersecurity reference. It will grow as I progress through PwnCollege and other CTFs.  
Feedback, questions, and pull requests are welcome.
